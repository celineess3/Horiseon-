# Horiseon 

## *Description*

As a marketing agency, web accessibility is increasingly important for assistive technologies for people with disabilities, promotes better positioning in search engines such as Google and avoids issues such as litigation. As a junior web developer, I was motivated to improve the HTML and CSS styling elements so that the code follows a semantic and logical structure as well as having accessible attributes. Additionally, I wanted other developers to be able to easily access my code, understand the programming decisions I have made and recommend suggestions to improve both the readability of the code and accessibility of the website. In completing this project, I learnt how to clone a repo without forking the original file, improved my skills in understanding semantic structure and proper CSS formating.

       correctly cloned

   2d. Mirror push to the new repository using cd urban-octo-telegram.git and git push --mirror **https://github.com/celineess3/Horiseon-**

### **Issues with Installation**

However, I found that I did run in to some initial issues when deploying the committed changes which required some changes to the file structure and git origin 

In Microsoft VS Code, the files HTML and folder assets needed to be extracted from the develop folder. 

2f. git remote -v
2g. git add .
2h. git commit -m "Fix File Structure"
2i. git push origin main (which did not work)
2j. git push -- force origin main
